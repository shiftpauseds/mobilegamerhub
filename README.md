   If Mass Effect and Starfield had a mobile lovechild, this is it. Jaw-dropping graphics, branching stories, choices that actually matter. I’ve replayed it three times and still find new endings.

   ![Mythhaven Chronicles Reforged - turn-based battle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grok-images/mobilegamerhub-images/main/mythhaven-chronicles-reforged.webp)  
   Turn-based combat that rewards brains over wallet. The story hit me so hard I teared up at chapter 9. Zero in-app purchases. Full stop.
